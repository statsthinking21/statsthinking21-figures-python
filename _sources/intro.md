This book contains Python code to create versions of each of the figures presented in *Statistical Thinking: Analyzing Data in an Uncertain World*, by Russell Poldrack, published by Princeton University Press.

Note: Some of the results differ between these examples and the book, due to differences in random sampling and filtering of the data in some cases.

Known problems:

- Ch 14: Crossvalidation results do not match R version
- Ch 17: Example 4 modeling results differ from R version
